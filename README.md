# Project-S
No translator supports dynamic hand gestures used for Indian Sign language. We harness the power of a neural network and train it using Indian Sign Language to bridge this gap. Most of the translators support ASL and lack the support of ISL. With our solution, we hope to cater to this under supported community of this country.
